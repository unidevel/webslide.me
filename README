This file will guide you to a properly running local development instance
of the webslide.me framework. You can easily run it on other hosts by
changing the $domain variable in the /api/index.php


--- --- --- --- --- --- ---
[1] Installation / Requirements

Currently, the webslide.me framework requires an underlying apache2 running.
There are plans to switch to NodeJS and there will be a shell script for
initial setup of the framework - but this is not commited to the repo yet.

If you haven't installed it on your linux yet, you can do that on Debian
or APT-based systems by running the following command in your terminal:

sudo aptitude install libapache2-mod-php5

* This command will also install several depencies, such as these packages:
apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-utils apache2.2-bin apache2.2-common
libapache2-mod-php5 libapr1 libaprutil1 libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3
libaprutil1-ldap php5-cli php5-common

[2] Configuration

The webslide.me framework also requires the mod_rewrite to be loaded.
Usually there's a folder /etc/apache2/sites-enabled wherein symlinks to
/etc/apache2/sites-available are stored.

Remember that Symlinks in the DocumentRoot folder (e.g. /var/www/vhost-folder)
are denied by default - so you should have an actual directory in there.

[2a] Create the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/webslide.me with the
following contents:

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName webslide.me
	ServerAlias webslide.me *.webslide.me
	DocumentRoot /var/www/webslide.me
	ServerAdmin christoph@martens.ms

	<Directory /var/www/webslide.me>
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny

		# This will deny external clients to access your development
		# instance. Safety first, right?
		Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128
	</Directory>

</VirtualHost>

[2b] Symlink the file to the sites-enabled folder by running this command
in your terminal:

sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/webslide.me /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/webslide.me

* Alternatively add the file contents to the END of the httpd.conf:


--- --- ---
[2c] Enable the mod_rewrite to let the .htaccess URL modifications run properly

sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/rewrite.load /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/rewrite.load

* Alternatively add the following line to the END of the httpd.conf:

LoadModule rewrite_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_rewrite.so


--- --- ---
[2d] Edit your /etc/hosts file to route webslide.me to your local host.
Add the following line to it on an IPv4 system (which is deprecated):

127.0.0.1	webslide.me

* On an IPv6 system, change the ::1 line and add a host behind ip6-loopback:
::1		ip6-localhost ip6-loopback webslide.me

[3] Restarting your apache daemon

Run the following command in your terminal to restart apache2:

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
